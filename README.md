Hello There, In the task I structured a project to Components, Pages, Hooks, and Context for state management. For redesigning the ChooseSkipSize page I used 4 components: StepCard, SelectedSkipCard, Stepper, and  Loader. For fetching data from API I used a custom hook. In-General, I am using React Query or RTK Query for handling API requests but here I have just one endpoint. You can check deploy version from here https://rem-waste-simple-task.vercel.app/

## For redesigning: 
# I changed the skip card component from a vertical card to a horizontal card with changes in styling.
# I changed the selected skip bar component styling to be more impressive.
